# Needs Brief: USIU First-Year Companion

## Background
New students at USIU often face challenges estimating weekly costs for transport and food around campus. Many donâ€™t have a clear tool for planning, which can lead to overspending. A simple freshman companion site will help students budget better and feel more prepared.

## Users
- **Primary Users:** Freshman USIU students who commute to campus.
- **Secondary Users:** Other students or mentors who want to share cost-saving tips.

## Needs Identified
1. A welcoming interface that greets students by name.  
2. A simple way to calculate **weekly transport and snack costs**.  
3. A reminder of possible savings (e.g., reducing spending by 10%).  
4. A day/night theme toggle for better readability in different conditions.  
5. Easy access through a browser, without requiring logins or installations.

## Objectives
- Make budgeting **visual, fast, and student-friendly**.  
- Teach first-years that small savings add up.  

## Constraints
- Is a  **static site** (HTML, CSS, JS only).  
- Runs in **Docker/Nginx** for easy deployment.  

## Next Steps
- Created  **wireframe** (done in Figma).  
- Developed the site in `public/` folder.  
- Tested functionality locally and in Docker.  
- Deliver README, needs brief, and wireframe for submission.
